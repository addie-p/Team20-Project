# Main Dashboard Screen
This is the main dashboard screen the user will see when clicking our website. The layout is designed for the ease of the user. 
- The restaurant and the dish it serves will be shown. The user will have the option to click 'like' or 'dislike'. When the user clicks 'dislike', it basically goes into trash. When the user clicks 'like', the restaurant will be saved into "Want to try!" section of the 'Your Restaurant" webpage. 
- On the dashboard screen we have also have a filter drop down menu, where there are different options to filter the distance, the price point, any restrictions and the different cruisines the user would like. 
- There is a navigatin bar on the top of the website to access the restaurants the user have clicked like - "Want to Try!" and the "Brackets" for the restaurants the user have been to and the Brackets page is where the user will choose between their liked restaurants (as a ranking system).
- At the bottom left of the website, there is a location button where the user can see the nearby restaurants and upon clicking on the markers the user can see the restaurant name and the cuisine.
