Main Dashboard Screen

This is the main dashboard screen the user will see when clicking our website. The layout is designed for the ease of the user. The restaurant and the dish it serves
will be shown. The user will have the option to swipe left or right. When the user swipes left, it basically goes into trash. When the user swipes right,
the restaurant and the dish will go into "want to try!" page. On the dashboard screen we have also have a filter drop down menu, where there are different 
options to filter the distance, the price point, any restrictions and the different cruisines the user would like. There is another dropdown on the right
side to access the restaurants the user have swiped right - "Want to Try!" and the "Visted" for the restaurants the user have been to. At the bottom right there is
a location button where the user can change the location to see restaurants for that particular location.

This is the "Want To Try!" page. This is where all the restaurants the user have swiped right on will be shown. Over here the user can see the general
rating of the restaurant and they have an option to "add" it. If the user clicks the add buttont they will add it to the "Visted" page.

This is the "Visted" page. Here the users get to see the restaurants they have visted it ( and also added from the "Want To Try!" page) in a carousel type of view. Here you can quick-rate the restaurants:- Write a review and rate the restuarant. The user has an option of enlarging the restuarant, so 
they can give an in-depth review of the restaurant.
