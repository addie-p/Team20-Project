# Application Features

## Recommendation System

The recommendation system in our web application will use personalized dining suggestions tailored for each users’ preferences. The algorithm behind this system will use content-based filtering to curate a dynamic list of recommendations. Users will be able to “swipe” (click) right, if they like a restaurant, or left, if they do not like a restaurant, with a limited number of swipes to ensure quality over quantity in swiping. This recommendation system will be designed to help users choose from a relevant list of restaurants they may be interested in, encouraging exploration while also prioritizing meaningful and decisive interactions.

## Saved Restaurants Dashboard

The saved restaurants dashboard will serve as a personalized hub for users to easily access and manage the restaurants that they “swiped” right on. Users can view details about the restaurants they saved such as the average rating, reviews, and photos of the restaurants to help them make comprehensive decisions when selecting where to dine. The dashboard will allow users to revisit the restaurants they like and choose from their top picks when planning meals. They will also be able to move the restaurant to the “Been To” category if they decide to go there.

## Filter System

The filters feature will allow users to refine their dining options based on specific preferences such as cuisine type, dietary preferences, distance, and price (low, medium, high). Users can narrow down a vast array of restaurants using the filters, streamlining the search process and only providing relevant recommendations. Users can also dynamically update the filters to adjust to their shifting preferences and to find an optimal restaurant for them.

## Geolocation/Option to Input Location

Users will be able to input their current location to receive recommendations for restaurants that are nearby or in their city/area. The filter system feature above will use this inputted location to provide users with recommendations that are within their preferred distance from their location. The location feature will give users an opportunity to find restaurant options in different, unfamiliar places if they are traveling or in their home city if they are not.

## Rating and Review System

This feature will allow users to give a star rating out of 5 stars once they have visited each restaurant. It will also provide users with a text box where they can write a review or short notes about their experiences and food they had at the restaurant. The feature motivates users to keep using the web application because they are able to keep track of which restaurants and foods they enjoyed and which ones they disliked. This can help them decide whether they want to go back to the restaurant if they are craving the same cuisine in the future.

## Photo Uploads

This feature will allow users to upload photos of the food they purchased and of the restaurant’s ambience after they have visited and moved the restaurant to the ‘Been To’ category. Adding photo uploads will help users remember each meal they had and whether they liked how the restaurant was set-up. This will also motivate them to return to the app when needing to make decisions about going back to the restaurant.

## Ranking Bracket System

Through this feature, users can participate in head-to-head matchups, where they vote for the restaurants they want to visit the most, as well as restaurants that they have been to, based on personal experiences and ratings. As users progress through the rounds, they narrow down their favorites, creating a personalized ranking of restaurants. The system dynamically updates scores based on their choices and ratings, essentially “gamifying” the decision-making process. This feature will allow users to organize the restaurants that they have saved and rank those that they have been to.
