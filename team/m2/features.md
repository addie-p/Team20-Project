# Application Features

## Recommendation System

The recommendation system in our web application will use personalized dining suggestions tailored for each users’ preferences. The algorithm behind this system will use content-based filtering to curate a dynamic list of recommendations. Users will be able to “swipe” (click) right, if they like a restaurant, or left, if they do not like a restaurant, with a limited number of swipes to ensure quality over quantity in swiping. This recommendation system will be designed to help users choose from a relevant list of restaurants they may be interested in, encouraging exploration while also prioritizing meaningful and decisive interactions.

## Saved Restaurants Dashboard

The saved restaurants dashboard will serve as a personalized hub for users to easily access and manage the restaurants that they “swiped” right on. Users can view details about the restaurants they saved such as the average rating, reviews, and photos of the restaurants to help them make comprehensive decisions when selecting where to dine. The dashboard will allow users to revisit the restaurants they like and choose from their top picks when planning meals. They will also be able to move the restaurant to the “Been To” category if they decide to go there.

## Filter System

The filters feature will allow users to refine their dining options based on specific preferences such as cuisine type, dietary preferences, distance, and price (low, medium, high). Users can narrow down a vast array of restaurants using the filters, streamlining the search process and only providing relevant recommendations. Users can also dynamically update the filters to adjust to their shifting preferences and to find an optimal restaurant for them.
