# Target Users:

## Primary Audience: 
The primary users of our web application are any range of people who are looking for a meal, but are indecisive about where to go. These individuals usually like to frequent restaurants and explore new cuisines. The recommendation system asks what the user wants at that moment to curate a list of restaurants matching those options. Through a “this-or-that” system, the indecisive user will be able to narrow down the options and finally end up with a restaurant choice suitable for their taste. The user will be able to save the restaurants that appear. The program will also allow the user to review the restaurants on a dashboard so that the user can see later on how they felt about it. This application is also catered towards restaurant enthusiasts and anyone who wants to keep track of what they are eating. Additionally, this can open the minds of new diners exploring different cuisines. As they get recommendations and write reviews, they can build their flavor profile and benefit from exploring cuisines.
