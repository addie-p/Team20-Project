- **Task**: Fixed the mini-map with the location dropdown in the filter system + Showing the restaurant markers from the database
- **Details**:The mini-map now pulls data from the database and puts a marker on the restaurant by comparing its latitude and longitudinal values. It also now works with the filter dropdown feature, where once the user chooses their location between 4 options - Amherst, Hadley, Northampton, South Hadley - the map should automatically zoom in at those specific locations and show the restaurants in those specific locations.
