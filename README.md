## Description
Plateful is a restaurant review web application designed to help users track and rank the restaurants they visit. Integrating a bracket system allows indecisive users to choose where they should eat based on specific preferences at the time of choice. The app uses geolocation to provide a user experience where users are able to associate their reviews with specific locations, as well as having a saved dashboard where they can access their reviews. It uses IndexedDB for efficient local data storage.

Plateful is designed for personal use and serves as a digital diary for food enthusiasts to catalog their dining experiences. 

Some key features are restaurant tracking, a rating system, photo upload, filtering system, and geolocation integration.
