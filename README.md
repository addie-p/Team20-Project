# Team20-Project

## Description
Plateful is a restaurant review web application designed to help users track and rank the restaurants they visit. Integrating a bracket system allows indecisive users to choose where they should eat based on specific preferences at the time of choice. The app uses geolocation to provide a user experience where users are able to associate their reviews with specific locations, as well as having a saved dashboard where they can access their reviews. It uses IndexedDB for efficient local data storage.

Plateful is designed for personal use and serves as a digital diary for food enthusiasts to catalog their dining experiences. 

Some key features are restaurant tracking, a rating system, photo upload, filtering system, and geolocation integration. 

## How to Run
Download the Live Server extension on VSCode and run the index.html file directly. Through the index.html file and navigation bar, the user will be able to access dashboard.html, rating.html, upload.html, and brackets.html. 

Updated run instructions (as of 12/08): To run the updated code with server-side integration, navigate to the back-end folder and run the server file. In your local terminal, in the project folder, run:
1. cd team/back-end
2. node Server.js
